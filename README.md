## Flight Delay Prediction
# Execution steps:
1. Upload the following dataset to the google drive [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses)
2. Open the following Colab link and mount the google drive. Then, provide the
dataset location in the cell where spark reads the csv data.[Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1W-6uqRekqods8xcOpH8_OO_68t7SoS7q?usp=sharing)
3. This program stores the processed data back in the drive. Note the folder/file
path.
4. Now, Open the following to run the Linear Regression Model by replacing the
read csv path with the processed data folder path [URL](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aSrda8tZLgr1p8S5CZkyN2gHpuSReBYe?usp=sharing)
5. Next, Open the following to run the Random Forest Model by replacing the read
csv path with the processed data folder path [URL]( https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19YFiUIzoHomoKhfheKIxanqJX4fnWuhk?usp=sharing)
6. Then, Open the following to run the Gradient Boosted Tree Model by replacing
the read csv path with the processed data folder path.[url](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wD21hiwZUSAfN-Stzk7rYG6CvXmlr7ai?usp=sharing)
7. Finally, you can also execute the following code to evaluate Gradient Boosted
Tree Model for various system metrics [ url](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14XqcBWC61ArfnK6AfNS-eydqS77_pVCC?usp=sharing)
8. Test data will be run automatically for each model and graph is displayed at end.
Note: We used multiple colab notebooks as it would be easy to evaluate each model
individually.
